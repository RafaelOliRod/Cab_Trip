# Cab Trip

In our most recent project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the operational data from a private transportation company, cross-referencing this information with weather data to understand how meteorological conditions influence the demand and usage of services.

## Project Objectives:

* **Identify Patterns:** Evaluate how different weather conditions (rain, temperature, wind, etc.) affect the number of rides taken.
* **Predict Demand:** Develop predictive models to anticipate demand variations based on weather forecasts.
* **Improve Planning:** Provide insights to optimize vehicle and resource allocation, minimizing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

## Methodology:

* **Data Collection:** We used historical ride data and detailed information on weather conditions from various reliable sources.
* **Statistical Analysis:** We applied statistical techniques to identify significant correlations between weather variables and service usage.
